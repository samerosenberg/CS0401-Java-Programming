[  ] PASCAL

[  ] PHP

[ X ] PYTHON

[  ] PERL

List any computer science courses you have taken in High School/College/Tech School etc.


1) Intro to Java


2) AP Computer Science A


3) AP Computer Science Principles



I understand these concepts from arithmetic:

[ X] arithmetic operators  + - / *

[ X] precedence of operations

[ X] boolean logic  AND NOT OR XOR




I understand these concepts from set theory:

[ X] union, intersection

[ ] set difference

[ ] XOR

[ ] cardinality, membership


I understand the following programming fairly well:

[ X] a variable

[ X] data types such as integer flaoting point string boolean

[ X] an if else statement

[ X] iteration & loops  such as while loop, for loop, do loop

[ X] method/functions/subroutines

[ X] passing parameters and return values

[ X] arrays

[ X] reading writing files

[ ] recursion

[ ] backtracking

[ ] dynamic programming


It has been this long since I have written a non trivial program

[ ] Never wrote any programs

[ X] more than a couple months

[ ] over a year

[ ] a few years



I have heard that this course is:

[ ] very easy

[ ] moderately easy

[ ] hard

[ ] extremely hard

[ X] heard nothing about it / no idea
