- A problem solving technique where an algorithm is defined in terms of itself
- recursive algorithm breaks down input or the search space ad applies the same logic to a smaller and smaller peive of the problem until the final
  piece is solvable without recursion
- "divide and conquer"

- any algorithm that is implemented using a loop can be written using recursion
- moving in the reverse direction is not always possible unless you maintain an additional data structure
