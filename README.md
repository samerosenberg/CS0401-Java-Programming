University of Pittsburgh
Intermediate Java Programming CS 0401
Instructor: Tim Hoffman

Course Description:
In this class, we will choose to describe our computer programs in a programming language called Java. Java is a programming language built around the creation and management of objects in terms of the data they contain and the code that acts upon them. There are many Object-Oriented Programming Languages, but Java is a good choice for both learning and real-life use. The skills that we learn in Java will be easily transferrable to other programming languages and even other programming paradigms.
